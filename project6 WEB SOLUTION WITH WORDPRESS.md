# Web Solution With WordPress
In this project i will be preparing storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress. WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). This project also showcases Three-tier Architecture while also certifying that the disks used to store files on the Linux servers are sufficiently partitioned and handled through programs such as gdisk and LVM respectively.

3-Tier Setup

• A Laptop or PC to serve as a client

• An EC2 Linux Server as a web server (housing WordPress)

• An EC2 Linux server as a database (DB) server

### This project 6 consists of two parts:

*Part 1:* Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS: The focus of this part is to give you practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

*part 2:* Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server: This part of the project will solidify your skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.
